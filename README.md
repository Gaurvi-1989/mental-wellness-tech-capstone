-Roll No.: 24109033
This repository contains analysis and interactive tools designed to understand and address mental health in the tech workforce, using advanced machine learning and data science.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Predicts who may seek mental health treatment (classification)
- Explores age patterns in mental health (regression)
- Segments tech employees into meaningful personas (clustering + UMAP)
- ✨ Features
🔍 1. Predictive Modeling
Goal: Identify individuals more likely to seek mental health treatment.
Tech: XGBoost & Random Forest classification models.
Output: ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance plots.

📈 2. Regression Analysis
Goal: Examine how age influences mental health indicators.
Tech: Linear & Ridge regression.
Output: Regression plots with statistical summaries.

🧩 3. Clustering & Personas

Goal: Segment tech workers into mental wellness personas.
Tech: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA, and UMAP dimensionality reduction.
Output: Persona descriptions and cluster visualizations.

📊 4. Interactive Data Exploration
Visualizations: Univariate, bivariate, multivariate plots.
Tools: Streamlit-powered dashboard for live analy
